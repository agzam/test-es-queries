#+title: Script to test different queries with Elasticsearch

* Preliminaries
- babashka
- the script assumes that Elasticsearch instances running on localhost
* How it works
Based on queries.edn, it would:

- Delete indices described in ~:default-index-mapping~. Note that the format may differ for different versions of ES
- Create indices. If a query map has ~:index-mapping~ key (with nested map of ES version keys , similar to ~default-index-mapping~), that mapping would be used, otherwise ~default-index-mapping~.
- Post some documents, either based on info in ~:documents~ key of the query map, or ~:default-documents~
- Send a query, print the results
- Each query map optionally can have ~:versions~ key with a vector of ES versions to run the query. Otherwise posts the query to ES 5 and 7
